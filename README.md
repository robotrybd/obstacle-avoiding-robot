Why RoboBox?
RobotryBD is bringing “RoboBox” -All in one to start learning robotics” to solve all the problems. It is very difficult to find these resources of robotics in the Bengali language or on YouTube. So with RoboBox, students can build at least 5 types of basic robots and 1000+ basic projects as well as advanced-level projects from this box. There will be regular courses, tutorials, weekly live sessions, Arduino Programming, and many more to make you proficient in fluent Bengali language from the hands of robotics. In addition, there will be one-to-one live support sessions for making robots or projects.
